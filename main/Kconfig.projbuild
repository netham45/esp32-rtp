        Enable RTCP (RTP Control Protocol) for media synchronization.
        RTCP provides timing information from RTP senders and statistics
        about the quality of reception.

        Target latency for synchronized audio playout.
        Lower values reduce delay but may cause dropouts.
        Higher values increase buffering and stability.

config RTCP_LOG_SYNC_INFO
    bool "Log RTCP synchronization info"
    default n
    depends on RTCP_ENABLED
    help
        Enable logging of RTCP synchronization information.
        This includes clock offset and playout timing details.
        Useful for debugging but may be verbose.

    help
        Send RTCP Receiver Reports (RR) back to the sender.
        These reports contain reception statistics that help
        the sender adapt to network conditions.
